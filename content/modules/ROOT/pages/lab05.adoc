= Post-Install Configuration

**Congratulations** you've successfully created an OpenShift cluster in a disconnected environment!

ðŸª© ðŸ’ƒ It's DISCO time! ðŸ•º ðŸª©

Or, perhaps, your cluster will finish installing in the next ~30 minutes. ðŸ˜¸

Don't worry!
Your workshop environment also includes a previously-built disconnected **Salsa cluster**.
You can complete this lab using either cluster.

== Are we done yet?

Installing OpenShift in a disconnected environment concludes the __"day 1"__ tasks.
However, a disconnected cluster is more useful when you make a few simple configuration changes.
These are commonly referred to as __"day 2"__ tasks.

Here are a few suggested __"day 2"__ tasks that will improve your experience.

{counter:overview}. Disable the default app / Operator `CatalogSources`

{counter:overview}. Create your own app / Operator `CatalogSource`

{counter:overview}. Install additional `ImageContentSourcePolicies`

{counter:overview}. Update OpenShift from a disconnected _Update Server_

[INFO]
You may not have enough time during the Summit 2024 lab session to complete the __Update Server__ task.

== Accessing your cluster

Because of time constraints, we recommend that you decide now to either use your [.highside]#disco.lab cluster#, or the prebuilt [.salsa]#salsa.lab cluster#.

The instructions are the same - only the names change.

=== Retrieving the default `kubeadmin` password

The OpenShift install process creates a randomized password for the default cluster administrative user, `kubeadmin` and it is printed when `openshift-install` finishes.
However, if you don't want to wait or your terminal output is gone you can lookup the password:

With the [.highside]#highside system#:

[.highside,source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
echo "URL: https://console-openshift-console.apps.disco.lab"
echo "Username: kubeadmin"
echo "Password: $(more /mnt/high-side-data/install/auth/kubeadmin-password)"
----
[.output]
----
URL: https://console-openshift-console.apps.disco.lab
Username: kubeadmin
Password: *****-*****-*****-*****
----

[TIP]
--
The pre-built **salsa.lab** cluster has preconfigured authentication for the purposes of this lab:

* There is a cluster-admin user available as `admin` / `admin`.
* There is also a non-admin user available as `user` / `user`.
--

=== Accessing the cluster with the command-line interface

We can access either cluster from the [.lowside]#jump system#:

[cols="a,a",options="header"]
|===
| Using the pre-built [.salsa]#salsa.lab cluster#
| Using your own [.highside]#disco.lab cluster#

|
[.lowside,source,bash,role=execute]
----
ssh salsa-registry
----
[.salsa,source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc login https://api.salsa.lab:6443 --username admin --password admin
----
|
[.lowside,source,bash,role=execute]
----
ssh highside
----
[.highside,source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc login https://api.disco.lab:6443 --username kubeadmin 
----

|
* *Username:* admin
* *Password:* admin
|
* *Username:* kubeadmin
* *Password:* (that we found above on the [.highside]#highside system#)
|===

[WARNING]
--
The copy-paste commands below assume that you will be using the pre-built [.salsa]#salsa.lab cluster#.
--

=== Accessing the cluster's web console

Now you can click the *Desktop* button on the right-hand side of the lab web interface and use Firefox to login to the OpenShift __Web Console__.
The __Web Console__ is the very last part of OpenShift to come online.
If you are trying to connect to your [.highside]#disco.lab# cluster, and see an "**Application is not available**" message, it means the installation hasn't completed yet.

Your workshop environment includes a Firefox bookmark to quickly connect with the __Web Console__.

The web-based VNC client is a bit klunky when it comes to **copy** and **paste**.
You can copy and paste into the VNC desktop using __noVNC__'s tool ribbon (hidden by default.)

// === Accessing the cluster from the command-line

// You should be able to access the API server from the *highside* system by leveraging the `kubeconfig` file the installer creates for you:

// [.highside,source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
// ----
// mkdir -vp $HOME/.kube
// cp -v /mnt/high-side/install/auth/kubeconfig $HOME/.kube/config
// oc status
// ----
// [.output]
// ----
// In project default on server https://api.disco.lab:6443

// svc/openshift - kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local
// svc/kubernetes - 172.30.0.1:443 -> 6443

// View details with 'oc describe <resource>/<name>' or list resources with 'oc get all'.
// ----

// Now that you're logged in via the command-line or the _Web Console_ we can proceed with the __"day 2"__ tasks.

=== Add our custom catalog source
// https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/installing/installing_aws/installing-restricted-networks-aws-installer-provisioned.html#olm-restricted-networks-operatorhub_installing-restricted-networks-aws-installer-provisioned

In order to deploy Operators from the customized catalog that was created in the `mirror-registry`, we have to add a new `CatalogSource` to OpenShift.
We also need to disable the default CatalogSources.
OpenShift clusters, by default, will try to use the online/connected versions of the Operator Catalogs from registry.redhat.io.

First, we will disable the default sources from the disconnected [.salsa]#salsa.lab cluster#.

[.salsa,source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc patch OperatorHub cluster --type merge -p '{"spec": {"disableAllDefaultSources": true}}'
----

Next, we will add the customized `CatalogSource` that `oc-mirror` created for us.

[INFO]
--
New `CatalogSources` can take 1-5 minutes to appear in the Web Console.
--

[.salsa,source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc create -f oc-mirror-workspace/results-*/catalogSource-cs-redhat-operator-index.yaml
----

Now we should see the Operators that we mirrored over with `oc-mirror` in the OperatorHub on the OpenShift Web Console for [.salsa]#salsa.lab cluster# 

image::disconnected-operator-catalog.png[Screenshot of the disco.lab instance of OpenShift Web Console showing OperatorHub with a custom CatalogSource]

=== Deploy an Operator

Go ahead and install the `Web Terminal` Operator. The cluster will pull all images from our disconnected registry mirror.

// == Add images with `podman`
// https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/post_installation_configuration/cluster-tasks.html#post-install-must-gather-disconnected

// == Remove default samples operator
// https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/openshift_images/configuring-samples-operator.html#configuring-samples-operator

=== Update cluster

// First log into the [.salsa]#salsa-registry system#

// [.lowside,source,bash,role=execute]
// ----
// ssh salsa-registry
// ----

// Next log into the [.salsa]#salsa.lab cluster#

// [.salsa,source,bash,role=execute]
// ----
// oc login https://api.salsa.lab:6443 --username admin --password admin
// ----

Apply the release signatures for verifying the release images

[.salsa,source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc apply -f oc-mirror-workspace/results-*/release-signatures
----
[.output]
----

----

We will be updating the cluster with the command line which is the simplest way to do upgrades in a disconnected environment

// TODO add callout for other upgrade methods
// TODO talk about getting release image digest from mirror registry directly

[.salsa,source,bash,role=execute]
----
podman login -u init -p salsapass $(hostname):8443
DIGEST=$(oc image info -o json $HOSTNAME:8443/openshift/release-images:4.14.20-x86_64 | jq -r .contentDigest)
oc adm upgrade --to-image=quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release@$DIGEST --allow-explicit-upgrade
----
[.output]
