= Accessing the Cluster

You should be able to access the API server from the bastion by leveraging the `kubeconfig` file the installer creates for you:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
export KUBECONFIG=/mnt/high-side/install/auth/kubeconfig
oc status
----

Example output:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
In project default on server https://api.disco.sandbox2099.opentlc.com:6443

svc/openshift - kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local
svc/kubernetes - 172.30.0.1:443 -> 6443

View details with 'oc describe <resource>/<name>' or list resources with 'oc get all'.
----

== Accessing the Web Console

. Now you should be able to access the console in the VNC session:
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc whoami --show-console
----

Success!

Now the cluster's up and we can successfully access it.

== What's next?

There's much work to be done after the initial installation.
As a cluster administrator, you need to be mindful of how to manage operators, upgrades, patching, configuration, and much more.
Stay tuned for future workshop modules where we'll examine these areas more closely.

Happy coding!
