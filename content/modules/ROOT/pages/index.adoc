= OpenShift Disconnected Workshop

Welcome to the OpenShift Disconnected Workshop! It's DISCO time! ðŸ’ƒðŸ•º

In this workshop you will learn about, prepare for, install and operate an OpenShift 4 cluster in a disconnected network.
This is also known as installing OpenShift in a https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/installing/installing_aws/installing-restricted-networks-aws-installer-provisioned.html#installation-about-restricted-networks_installing-restricted-networks-aws-installer-provisioned[_restricted network_ or an _air gap_ network].
The workshop environment (illustrated below) gives you access to several servers/systems in different networks.

[TIP]
--
The term "disconnected" can mean different things to different people.

This workshop describes one particular way of performing a disconnected installation.
Another way, not described here, would be to setup, secure, and use a proxy server.
You could also install OpenShift with a temporary connection to the installation resources and remove the access later.

== Who uses disconnected networks?

Before we begin, consider a few use cases for disconnected networks:

* *Military & Law Enforcement*: Often need secure environments to handle sensitive data
* *Research organizations*: Want to protect their data / provide data governance
* *Industrial / utility*: Use SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) networks to protect control and operation data

== Understanding our lab environment

The image below illustrates the varios networks, systems, and connections this workshop provides.
The lab instructions will help you create the `openshift.disco.lab` cluster which doesn't exist yet.

=== Lab Access and Documentation notes

The terminal window to your right is *already* logged into the [.lowside]#`jump`# system.
The right-hand side of this browser can also show the [.lowside]#`jump`# system's graphical desktop by click on the *Desktop* button.
The lab instructions should be run as the `{bastion_ssh_user_name}` user.

If you prefer to use your own terminal, you can log into the [.lowside]#`jump`# system using SSH like this:

[source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
# Your unique lab-user password is {bastion_ssh_password}
{bastion_ssh_command}
----
