= OpenShift Disconnected Workshop

Welcome to the OpenShift 4 Disconnected Workshop!

Here you will learn about how to install and operate an OpenShift 4 cluster in a disconnected network, or one without access to the Internet (even through a proxy or firewall).
This changes the way the cluster operates because things like container images, operator updates, and patches must be brought into the environment via *mirroring*.

== Who uses disconnected networks?

Before we begin, consider a few use cases for disconnected networks:

* *Law enforcement*: Disconnected networks are private and purpose built
* *Research organizations*: Disconnected networks provide data governance
* *Industrial control*: Disconnected networks provide a security layer for supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
* *The Military*: Disconnected networks provide alternative, reliable communication methods

== Understanding our lab environment

There are of course many different options for installing OpenShift in a restricted network, this is just one fairly opinionated approach using AWS infrastructure. We will do our best to point out where there is the potential for variability along the way.

=== Lab Access

The terminal window to your right is *already* logged into the lab environment as the `{bastion_ssh_user_name}` user via `ssh`.
All steps of this lab are to be completed as the `{bastion_ssh_user_name}` user.
