= Logging in to your OpenShift Cluster

**Congratulations** you've successfully created an OpenShift cluster in a disconnected environment!

ðŸª© ðŸ’ƒ It's DISCO time! ðŸ•º ðŸª©

Or, perhaps, your cluster will finish installing in the next ~30 minutes. ðŸ˜¸

Don't worry!
Your workshop environment also includes a previously-built disconnected **Salsa** cluster.

//TODO - more highlighting for the [.salsa] objects???

== Are we done yet?

Installing OpenShift in a disconnected environment concludes the "day 1" tasks.
However, a disconnected cluster is more useful when you make a few simple configuration changes.
These are commonly referred to as "day 2" tasks.

Here are a few suggested "day 2" tasks that will improve your experience.

{counter:overview}. Disable the default app / Operator `CatalogSources`

{counter:overview}. Create your own app / Operator `CatalogSource`

{counter:overview}. Install additional `ImageContentSourcePolicies`

{counter:overview}. Update OpenShift from a disconnected _Update Server_

* You may not have enough time in the Summit 2024 lab break-out to complete this task

== Accessing your cluster

Because of time constraints, we recommend that you decide now to either use your **disco.lab** cluster, or the prebuilt **salsa.lab** cluster.

The instructions are the same - only the names change.

We will assume for now that you will be using the pre-built **salsa.lab** cluster.

=== Accessing the cluster's web console

Before you launch a web browser, you need to find the randomized password that was assigned to your cluster's `kubeadmin` user.
The password is printed when `openshift-install` finishes.
But, if you don't want to wait, you can lookup the password with these commands:

[.highside,source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
echo "URL: https://console-openshift-console.apps.disco.lab"
echo "Username: kubeadmin"
echo "Password: $(more /mnt/high-side-data/install/auth/kubeadmin-password)"
----
[.output]
----
URL: https://console-openshift-console.apps.disco.lab
Username: kubeadmin
Password: fKLcS-EuJDs-SfrVD-nbbvA
----

[TIP]
--
The pre-built **salsa.lab** cluster credentials are `admin` / `admin`.

There is also a non-admin user available with `user` / `user`.
--

Now you can click the *Desktop* button on the right-hand side and use Firefox to login to the OpenShift __Web Console__.
The __Web Console__ is the very last part of OpenShift to come online.
If you are trying to connect to your [.highside]#disco.lab# cluster, and see an "**Application is not available**" message, it means the installation has completed yet.

Your workshop environment includes a Firefox bookmark to quickly connect with the __Web Console__.

The web-based VNC client is a bit klunky when it comes to **copy** and **paste**.
You can copy and paste into the VNC desktop using __noVNC__'s tool ribbon (hidden by default.)

//TODO - cleanup needed here
=== Accessing the cluster from the command-line

You should be able to access the API server from the *highside* system by leveraging the `kubeconfig` file the installer creates for you:

[.highside,source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
mkdir -vp $HOME/.kube
cp -v /mnt/high-side/install/auth/kubeconfig $HOME/.kube/config
oc status
----
[.output]
----
In project default on server https://api.disco.lab:6443

svc/openshift - kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local
svc/kubernetes - 172.30.0.1:443 -> 6443

View details with 'oc describe <resource>/<name>' or list resources with 'oc get all'.
----

There's much work to be done after the initial installation.
As a cluster administrator, you need to be mindful of how to manage operators, upgrades, patching, configuration, and much more.


== Post-Install Cluster Configuration

Now that we have a cluster up and running (or we are using the pre-made salsa.lab cluster) we can perform some
post-install steps that are specific to a disconnected environment.

First, lets log in to our cluster
