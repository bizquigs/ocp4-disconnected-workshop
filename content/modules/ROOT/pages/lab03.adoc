= Setup the High Side

In this lab we will setup the [.highside]#highside# system.
Recall from the architecture diagram (below) that you will configure the [.highside]#highside# system to run an _image registry_ inside the disconnected network.
We'll use OpenShift's `mirror-registry` as our _image registry_.
The `mirror-registry` is a simplified version of Red Hat's Quay Image Registry.
You can use any _image registry_ you like, as long as it supports the Docker v2 API, [.underline]#uses TLS encryption, and requires authenticated image pulls#.
Examples of alternative _image registries_ include.

* Harbor
* JFrog Artifactory
* Sonatype Nexus Repository
* Red Hat Quay Registry (enterprise)

== Lab Overview

The tasks in this lab include:

{counter:overview}. Connecting to the [.highside]#highside# system and proving that its disconnected

{counter:overview}. Transfering the installation content to the [.highside]#highside# system using `rsync`

{counter:overview}. Installing the `mirror-registry`

* Trusting the generated TLS certificate
* Logging in and creating a _pull secret_

{counter:overview}. Uploading the `.tar` file's contents into the `mirror-registry`

== Log into the highside system

In your workshop environment you cannot log into the [.highside]#highside# system directly because its in a disconnected network.
Many customers access their disconnected systems using a VPN, a jump server, or with dedicated workstations.

Passwordless SSH has been enabled for your convenience.
Please log into the [.highside]#highside# system using `ssh` from the [.lowside]#jump# system.

== Prove that highside is disconnected

image::disco-5.svg[disco diagram,800]

[NOTE]
--
The [.highside]#highside systems# are configured to use a `nat / squid proxy` server to access a few resources

{counter:exceptions}. The [.highside]#highside# system allows inbound SSH connections from the [.lowside]#jump system#

{counter:exceptions}. The [.highside]#highside# system is allowed to install RHEL RPMs from the repos inside the Amazon AWS Cloud (not from the public repos at https://cdn.redhat.com)

{counter:exceptions}. Your [.highside]#openshift.demo.lab# cluster will be allowed to talk to the Amazon AWS Cloud APIs. More details about this permission will be provided in the next lab

{counter:exceptions}. ðŸ›‘ **nothing else** ðŸ›‘ is allowed into or out of the [.highside]#highside network#

The xref:appendix01.adoc[Appendix] has more information about the `nat / squid` proxy configuration.
--

Please use the following commands to prove that the [.highside]#highside# system is unable to connect to [.underline]#openshift.com# and [.underline]#quay.io#.

You may recall that:

* The `oc` and `openshift-install` tools were downloaded from [.underline]#openshift.com#
* The OpenShift installation images were downloaded from [.underline]#quay.io#

If you try to access a blocked website, [.underline]#quay.io#, you'll see an **Acces Denied** message like this.

[.highside,source,bash,role=execute]
----
curl -I quay.io
----
[.output]
----
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden

----

The [.highside]#highside# system is configured to install RPMs (like `podman`) from the Red Hat Update Infrastructure (RHUI) repos inside the Amazon AWS Cloud.
The output for an allowed website, like that repo, will look similar to this:
[.highside,source,bash,role=execute]

== Moving the installation content onto highside

[WARNING]
Ensure that your `oc mirror` command has completed successfully before proceeding with this lab.
You can confirm the mirroring has finished by looking in your `tmux` pane to see if your prompt has returned.

[lab-user@jump low-side-data]$ 
----

After the `oc-mirror` command has completed, use `rsync` on the [.lowside]#jump# system to copy the installation content into `/mnt/high-side-data` on the [.highside]#highside# system.

[WARNING]
--
Please run the `rsync` command in your `tmux` screen.
This will allow you to keep working on the next section while `rsync` moves ~25 GB of data.
The `rsync` tasks should complete in about 5 minutes.

== Creating a Mirror Registry

[TIP]
--
You can begin working on this section while the previous `rsync` command is still copying data.
`rsync` transfers files alphabetically, which is good for us because `mirror-registry` transfers before the larger `.tar` file.
--

Now that the [.highside]#highside# system has the mirroring tools and installation content transferred, we can setup the `mirror-registry`.
The command below will change directories and set the `mirror-registry` password to `discopass` for the `init` user.
The automation that installs and configures the `mirror-registry` takes ~5 minutes to complete.
Unfortunately we can't move on to the next step of trusting the TLS certificate until the `mirror-registry` has finished installed.

[.highside,source,bash,role=execute]
----
cd /mnt/high-side-data
./mirror-registry install --initPassword discopass
----
[.output]
----
...
INFO[2023-07-06 15:43:41] Quay installed successfully, config data is stored in /home/lab-user/quay-install
INFO[2023-07-06 15:43:41] Quay is available at https://ip-10-0-51-47.ec2.internal:8443 with credentials (init, discopass)
----

[NOTE]
The `mirror-registry` is installed with a TLS certificate that is not trusted by anything, not even the [.highside]#highside# system where it was installed.

The procedure to trust the `mirror-registry` TLS certificate is simple.
Copy the Certificate Authority file (rootCA.pem) into the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CA trust directory.
Then run the `update-ca-trust` command.

[.highside,source,bash,role=execute]
----
sudo cp -v /home/lab-user/quay-install/quay-rootCA/rootCA.pem /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/
sudo update-ca-trust
----

After the `mirror-registry` TLS certificate has been trusted, use `podman` to login.
The username is `init` and the password `discopass`.

[.highside,source,bash,role=execute]
----
podman login -u init -p discopass $(hostname):8443
----
[.output]
----
Login Succeeded!
----

The `podman login` command created an authentication file / (_pull secret_) at `/run/user/1000/containers/auth.json`.
Note that the `oc-mirror` command looks for _pull secrets_ in both locations:

* `$HOME/.docker/config.json` (created on the [.lowside]#lowside jump# system)
* `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/containers/auth.json` (created on the [.highside]#highside# system)

== Mirroring Content

Now that the [.highside]#highside# system trusts the `mirror-registry's` TLS certificate, and `podman` has logged in and created a new _pull secret_, we're ready to upload the installation images from the `.tar`` file.

We'll begin by adding the `oc`, `oc-mirror` and `openshift-install` commands to the PATH.

[.highside,source,bash,role=execute]
----
sudo mv -v /mnt/high-side-data/oc /bin/
sudo mv -v /mnt/high-side-data/oc-mirror /bin/
sudo mv -v /mnt/high-side-data/openshift-install /bin/
----

[WARNING]
--
Please run the next `oc-mirror` command in your `tmux` screen.
This will allow you to keep working on the next section while `oc-mirror` uploads ~25 GB of data into the `mirror-registry`.
The `oc-mirror` task should complete in about 15 minutes.
--

[.highside,source,bash,role=execute]
----

You can click the *Desktop* button and use Firefox to login to your new `mirror-registry`.
You can even see the OpenShift installation images begin to appear.
Don't spend too much time exploring the `mirror-registry's` web pages.
We need to start the next section, **Installing OpenShift**
