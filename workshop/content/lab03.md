In this lab, we'll create an Air Gap in AWS.

1. Configure your AWS CLI with the credentials you received from RHDP. Be sure to use the `us-east-1` region and specify your output type as `json`:
   ```execute
   aws configure
   ```
2. Create a key pair and import it to AWS. We're going to use this to SSH into our **prep system** and **bastion server**:
   ```execute
   ssh-keygen -f ./disco_key
   ```
   ```execute
   KEY_NAME=disco-key
   aws ec2 import-key-pair --key-name $KEY_NAME --public-key-material fileb://./disco_key.pub
   ```
   > Depending how you're running this workshop, you may receive the following error:
     ```bash
     An error occurred (AuthFailure) when calling the DescribeSubnets operation: AWS was not able to validate the provided access credentials
     ```
     This is likely due to your system's date being out of sync. You can confirm this by comparing the system's date to the current local time:
     ```execute
     date
     ```
     If the system date is too far behind, AWS will reject any requests to its API with a 405. If you're running `podman machine`, this can be fixed by running:
     ```bash
     podman machine ssh "sudo systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd.service"
     ```
3. Instantiate a CloudFormationTemplate. This creates a VPC that houses both sides of the air gap:
   ```execute
   # Grab the template file from the repo
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/naps-product-sa/ocp4-disconnected-workshop/main/cloudformation.yaml -o cloudformation.yaml

   # Create the stack
   aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name disco --template-body file://./cloudformation.yaml --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
   ```
4. We just created a VPC with 3 public subnets, which will serve as our Low Side, and 3 private subnets, which will serve as our High Side. You can view them by running the command below:
   ```execute
   aws ec2 describe-subnets | jq '[.Subnets[].Tags[] | select(.Key=="Name").Value] | sort'
   ```
   > This may take a minute or two while the resources in the stack are created.
   
   Example output:
   ```bash
   [
      "Private Subnet - disco",
      "Private Subnet 2 - disco",
      "Private Subnet 3 - disco",
      "Public Subnet - disco",
      "Public Subnet 2 - disco",
      "Public Subnet 3 - disco"
   ]
   ```
   The high side protects outbound traffic with a [Squid proxy](http://www.squid-cache.org/) running in a NAT instance. The proxy prevents any egress traffic not listed in `/etc/squid/whitelist.txt` on that host. If you look at the template you'll notice our two entries are:
   * `.amazonaws.com`
   * `.cloudfront.net`
   There may be situations where you wish to add more exceptions here, such as container or package repositories.

Now that our air gap is in place, let's start prepping the low side.
