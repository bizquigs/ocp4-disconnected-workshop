= Lab Finish

*Thank you* for attending this lab session on creating and managing OpenShift in a disconnected environment!

While we understand that disconnected environments in a cloud like AWS may be the exception rather than the rule, 
we hope that you have learned more about the processes around installing and managing OpenShift disconnected.
