== Useful `tmux` commands

image::tmux-logo-medium.png[tmux logo]

[%hardbreaks]
https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki[`tmux`,window=_blank] is a terminal multiplexer, similar to https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/[GNU `screen`,window=_blank].
`tmux` allows this Workshop's Showroom website to run multiple terminals.
`tmux` also allows long-running commands, like `oc-mirror` to run in the background after you logout.

The OpenShift Disconnected workshop encourages users to use multiple `tmux` panes in order to conserve time.
Without `tmux`, workshop users would have to wait anywhere from 5 minutes to 45 minutes for the various `oc-mirror`, `rsync` and `openshift-install` tasks to complete.

This appendix will introduce three additional `tmux` commands that workshop users may find helpful. You're encouraged to follow the links to the official documentation, as long as it doesn't distract you from the ðŸª© ðŸ’ƒ DISCO party! ðŸ•º ðŸª©

=== new-session

Creating a new `tmux` session is as easy as typing `tmux` because the default behavior when running the command is to create a new session. You could also type `tmux new-session` or `tmux new` as well, but you would only do that if you wanted to give a cool name to your session.
[%hardbreaks]
For example, `tmux new -s disco`.

=== list-sessions

`tmux` sessions continue running in the background if your connection is interrupted.
Your connection to `tmux` could be interrupted if you close your browser tab or abruptly terminate your PuTTY, iTerm2, or SSH connections.

You can list all of the running sessions with the `tmux list-sessions` command, or with the handy `tmux ls` alias.

You'll notice in the example below that there are two `tmux` sessions running.
The first session is called `0` and is likely running your `oc-mirror` tasks.
The second session is called `disco` and is the result of running `tmux new -s disco`.

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
tmux ls
----
[.output]
----
[lab-user@jump low-side-data]$ tmux ls
0: 1 windows (created Fri May  3 04:16)
disco: 1 windows (created Fri May  3 05:43)
----

=== attach-session

Reconnecting to a disconnected `tmux` session is easy.
If there is only one session running, you can re-attach using the command `tmux attach-session` or simply `tmux a` because `tmux` commands can be shortened to their least-ambiguous form.
No other `tmux` commands start with the letter `a`. ðŸ˜¸

If you have multiple `tmux` sessions running in the background, you need to __"target"__ the session you want to **attach** to.
You could attach to the `disco` session by typing `tmux a -t disco`.
Or, you could attach to the `0` session by typing `tmux a -t 0`.

// BEGIN TMUX "SCREENSHOT"
[source,bash,role=execute]

tmux a -t 0

== Sending commands to `tmux`

Many commands can be sent to `tmux` when you are inside of a session.
For example, you might want to __detach__, __enable mouse-mode__, or __split the window__.
Sending commands to `tmux` requires you to first send the **__"prefix"__** keystroke (Ctrl + b).

There are many `tmux` cheat sheets that help serve as a reminder while you become comfortable using `tmux`.
Consider this one on the https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/introduction-tmux-linux[Red Hat Sysadmin Blog,window=_blank].

Here is an abbreviated list of the commands that might be helpful for this workshop.

[%hardbreaks]
`Ctrl + b then d` - Detach from the current session
`Ctrl + b then %` - Split the window in half, left-right (horizontally)
`Ctrl + b then "` - Split the window in half, top-bottom (vertically)
`Ctrl + b then Arrow Key` - Move between panes when mouse-mode is off (Left, Right, Up, Down) 
`Ctrl + b then x` - Close the currently selected pane (with y/n prompt)
`Ctrl + b then c` - Create a new window
`Ctrl + b then w` - Open the window/pane navigator
`Ctrl + b then ?` - Get help / show all keybindings. Press Q to exit.
`Ctrl + b then :` - Enter the command line (with tab-completion) to type commands manually. ("set mouse on", "set mouse off")
