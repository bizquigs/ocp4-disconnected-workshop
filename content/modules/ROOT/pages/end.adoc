Thank you for attending the [.underline]#Red Hat OpenShift Disco Lab: Installation In A Disconnected Environment#!

Please use the Summit 2024 mobile app to leave feedback on how this Lab can be improved!

== Acknowledgements

This workshop gave you access to a disconnected environment in the Amazon AWS Cloud.
The workshop authors understand that the workshop environment may be more-or-less __disconnected__ than your environments.
Regardless, we hope that you learned more about the preparations and requirements of installing and managing OpenShift in a disconnected environment.

We would love to hear your disconnected stories, and learn how the entire disconnected experience could be improved!
