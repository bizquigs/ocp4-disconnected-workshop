= OpenShift Disconnected Workshop

Welcome to the OpenShift **__Disco__**nnected Workshop!

ðŸª© ðŸ’ƒ It's DISCO time! ðŸ•º ðŸª©

In this workshop you will learn about, prepare for, install and operate an OpenShift 4 cluster in a disconnected network.
This is also known as installing OpenShift in a https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/{openshift_version}/installing/installing_aws/installing-restricted-networks-aws-installer-provisioned.html#installation-about-restricted-networks_installing-restricted-networks-aws-installer-provisioned[_restricted network_ or an _air gap network_,window=_blank].
The workshop environment (illustrated below) gives you access to several servers/systems in different networks. The instructions and environments were created using OpenShift version `{openshift_min_version}`.

[TIP]
--
The term _disconnected network_ can mean different things to different people.

This workshop describes one particular way of performing a disconnected installation.
Another way would be to setup, secure, and use a proxy server.
You could also install OpenShift with a temporary connection to the installation resources and remove the access later.

== Who uses disconnected networks?

Before we begin let's consider a few use-cases for disconnected networks:

* *Military & Law Enforcement*: Often need secure environments to handle sensitive data
* *Research Organizations*: Want to protect their data & provide data governance
* *Industrial / Utilities*: Use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCADA[SCADA,window=_blank] networks to protect their supervisory and control machinery

== Understanding our lab environment

The image below illustrates the various networks, systems, and connections this workshop provides.
The diagram will be simplifed and explained in more detail in later chapters.
The workshop instructions will help you prepare the [.lowside]#jump system# to download the installation content, setup the [.highside]#highside system# system to host the content, and create the [.highside]#openshift.disco.lab cluster# -- which doesn't exist yet.

The **salsa network** and its systems are built automatically when the workshop environment is created.
You can log into the **salsa systems** to compare your systems with functional disconnected systems.

=== Lab Access and Documentation notes

The terminal window to your right is *already* logged into the [.lowside]#jump system's# *SSH Terminal*.
The right-hand side of this browser can also show the [.lowside]#jump system's# graphical desktop by clicking on the *Desktop* button.

The lab instructions should be run as the user named `{bastion_ssh_user_name}`.

Commands that should be run on the [.lowside]#jump system# will appear in this color.

[.lowside,source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
echo "Run this command on the jump system"
echo "The jump system may also be referred to as the *lowside* system"
----

Commands that should be run on the [.highside]#highside system# will appear in this color.

[.highside,source,bash,role=execute]
----
echo "Run this command on the highside system"
----

[TIP]
--
Use the *Copy* button in the corner of the command text box to your advantage!
You can paste by pressing Ctrl-v or Shift + Insert
--

[NOTE]
--
The workshop labs intentionally avoid asking you to use `vi`, `nano`, or `emacs` to edit text files.

=== Alternate connection methods

If you prefer to use your own terminal, you can log into the [.lowside]#jump system# using SSH like this:

[source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
# Your unique lab-user password is {bastion_ssh_password}
{bastion_ssh_command}
----

If you prefer to use your own VNC viewer, you can connect to the [.lowside]#jump system's# graphical desktop like this:

[source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
# Your unique VNC password is {bastion_ssh_password}
vncviewer {JumpInstancePublicIp}
----
