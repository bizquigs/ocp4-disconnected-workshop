= Install OpenShift

You're almost there!

In this section you will create an `install-config.yaml` __"answer file"__ that the OpenShift Installer `openshift-install` will use to automatically create your disconnected [.highside]#openshift.disco.lab cluster#.

Installing OpenShift in a disconnected environment is as easy as adding three extra pieces of information to an `install-config.yaml`.

{counter:overview}. Provide your disconnected **__pull secret__**

{counter:overview}. Identify your disconnected `mirror-registry`

{counter:overview}. Trust the `mirror-registry's` TLS certificate

[NOTE]
--
We will also create an SSH key that can be used for debugging.
But nothing will go wrong, so we won't use it! ðŸ˜Š
Creating and SSH key is not required for any OpenShift installation, connected or disconnected.
But it's a good idea to include one, just in case...
--

The diagram below is a reminder that your [.highside]#openshift.disco.lab cluster# is completely disconnected from the public internet.
Aside from communicating with the AWS Cloud APIs to create its own DNS records, instances, and security groups -- your cluster is completely disconnected and will install from [.highside]#highside's# `mirror-registry`.

== Create the install-config.yaml

Instead of answering `openshift-install's` questions via its interactive wizard, this workshop shows you how to create the `install-config.yaml` __answer file__ from a template.

The template below provides the Amazon AWS cloud `region` and `subnet` values that are [.underline]#unique to your environment#.
The template also provides the DNS name (`disco.lab`) that OpenShift will use and tells `openshift-install` to create a Single Node Openshift (SNO) cluster by setting `compute.replicas` to `0` and `controlPlane.replicas` to `1`. Question, is a cluster of 1 still a cluster? ðŸ¤·

[WARNING]
--
Do not change any values in the `install-config.yaml` template below.

=== SSH key

image::install-config-2.svg[initial config,width=600]

Generate an SSH key that can be used to debug / troubleshoot the cluster nodes and add it to the `install-config.yaml`

[.highside,source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
ssh-keygen -C "OpenShift Debug" -N "" -f /mnt/high-side-data/id_rsa
echo "sshKey: $(cat /mnt/high-side-data/id_rsa.pub)" >> /mnt/high-side-data/install-config.yaml
----

=== Pull Secret

image::install-config-3.svg[initial config,width=600]

Your disconnected __pull secret__ contains the username and password for the `mirror-registry`.
However, the __pull secret__ created by `podman login` stores that information on multiple lines.
The `install-config.yaml` file expects your __pull secret__ to be on a single line.

Use `jq` to minify your __pull secret__ and add it to the `install-config.yaml`

[.highside,source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
echo "pullSecret: '$(jq -c . $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/containers/auth.json)'" >> /mnt/high-side-data/install-config.yaml
----

[NOTE]
--
Downloading the OpenShift installation images requires a _pull secret_ you download from the https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console,window=_blank].
That __pull secret__ provides credentials for several Red Hat image registries, including quay.io and registry.redhat.io.
The __pull secret__ that gets added to a disconnected installation's `install-config.yaml` is only required to provide credentials for the `mirror-registry`.
--

=== Add `imageContentSources`

image::install-config-4.svg[initial config,width=600]

When `oc-mirror` is done uploading the OpenShift installation images into the `mirror-registry` it creates a __result file__.
The contents of the `imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml` __result file__ must be added to the `install-config.yaml` __answer file__.

[WARNING]
Use the following command to check if `oc-mirror` on the [.highside]#highside# system has finished uploading the installation images.

[.highside,source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
if (test -e /mnt/high-side-data/oc-mirror-workspace/results-*/imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml)
  then
     echo -e "\n\n Looks good, go ahead! \n\n"
   else
     echo -e "\n\n Uh oh, something is wrong... \n\n"
fi
----

[WARNING]
--
If the check command said that something is wrong, please make sure that `oc-mirror` has finished uploading.

If the `oc-mirror` upload completed successfully, and the check command still says something is wrong, it's possible that your __results files__ were written to a different directory.
Look for a directory called `oc-mirror-workspace` on your [.highside]#highside# system.
Or ask a lab assistant for help.
--

When the check command says that everything looks good, you can add the `imageContentSources:` data to your `install-config.yaml` with the following command.

[.highside,source,bash,role=execute]
----
cat << EOF >> /mnt/high-side-data/install-config.yaml
imageContentSources:
$(grep "mirrors:" -A 2 --no-group-separator /mnt/high-side-data/oc-mirror-workspace/results-*/imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml)
EOF
----

Confirm that the `imageContentSources` were added to the bottom of your `install-config.yaml` with this command.
And that the output looks similar to the example below.

[.highside,source,bash,role=execute]
----
tail /mnt/high-side-data/install-config.yaml
----
[source,yaml]
----
imageContentSources:
  - mirrors:
     - ip-10-0-51-206.ec2.internal:8443/openshift/release-images
     source: quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release
  - mirrors:
     - ip-10-0-51-206.ec2.internal:8443/openshift/release
     source: quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-v4.0-art-dev
----

The `imageContentSources:` lines tell OpenShift that its installation images should be pulled from your `mirror-registry` instead of from quay.io

=== Trust mirror registry CA

image::install-config-5.svg[initial config,width=600]

Now that your `install-config.yaml` includes the location and credentials for your `mirror-registry`, the last step is to add the `mirror-registry's` TLS Certificate Authority (CA) data.

Add the Root CA of your `mirror-registry` to the trust bundle using the `additionalTrustBundle:` field by running this command:

[.highside,source,bash,role=execute]
----
cat << EOF >> /mnt/high-side-data/install-config.yaml
additionalTrustBundle: |
$(sed 's/^/  /' /home/lab-user/quay-install/quay-rootCA/rootCA.pem)
EOF
----

It should look something like this, including the 2 spaces of indentation.

[source,yaml]
----
additionalTrustBundle: |
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  ...
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
----

=== Complete install-config.yaml

Please make a backup of your `install-config.yaml`!
The OpenShift installer will consume it / delete it.

[.highside,source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
cp -v /mnt/high-side-data/install-config.yaml /mnt/high-side-data/install-config.yaml.backup
----

== Running the Installation

With all of the installation questions answered, `openshift-install` can now automate the installation of your disconnected cluster.
Let's kick off the cluster installation!

image::install-config-6.svg[initial config,width=600]

[NOTE]
--
The OpenShift Installer (`openshift-install`) is specifically built for every version / release.

This means that `openshift-install` version `{openshift_min_version}` will install OpenShift `{openshift_min_version}`.
It also means you can't use `openshift-install` version `{openshift_min_version}` to install OpenShift `{openshift_max_version}`.
--

Run the `openshift-install` command.
The command below includes the directory where your `install-config.yaml` __answer file__ is located.

[.highside,source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
openshift-install create cluster --dir /mnt/high-side-data
----
[.output]
----
...
INFO Install complete!
INFO To access the cluster as the system:admin user when using 'oc', run 'export KUBECONFIG=/mnt/high-side-data/auth/kubeconfig'
INFO Access the OpenShift web-console here: https://console-openshift-console.apps.disco.lab
INFO Login to the console with user: "kubeadmin", and password: "*****-*****-*****-*****"
INFO Time elapsed: 30m49s
----

[IMPORTANT]
This `disco.lab` cluster will take about 30 minutes to install but if you do not want to wait *proceed to the next section
to work on the pre-built salsa.lab cluster*!
